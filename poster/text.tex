\begin{abstract}
The heavy quark doublet plays a central role in the quest for new physics. The complementary between studies of electroweak top quark production and bottom quark production is therefore intuitively clear and pointed out in the literature.
The tension between the LEP measurement and the Standard Model prediction of the forward-backward asymmetry \afb\ is still one of the unsolved questions in the field and may be interpreted as a first manifestation of new physics in the heavy quark sector. The process $e^+e^-\to b\bar{b}$ at the ILC offers a unique opportunity for a final word on the tension. Polarised beams allow for a large disentangling of the coupling constants or form factors that govern the $Z^0/\gamma b \bar{b}$ vertex.

This poster presents a detailed simulation study of the process $e^+e^-\to b\bar{b}$ at 250\,GeV with the ILD Detector. Besides the phenomenological implications, the studies demonstrate that with a careful analysis of the final state the charge of the b-quarks can be determined on an event-by-event basis with the ILD Detector. Such a capability is unprecedented by past and present particle physics experiments.

So far, LEP~I has determined the b-quark couplings to the $Z^0$ boson by measuring the b partial width 
and the forward-backward asymmetry called \afb. 
These quantities provide the most precise value of $\sin^2\theta_W$ at LEP~I. It turns out that this value is at three standard deviation away from the very precise value from SLD using beam polarization~\cite{bib:AfbSMFit}. 
Redoing precisely this measurement is therefore a priority for future $e^+e^-$ colliders. 


In this study, we intend to prove that the International Linear Collider~\cite{bib:ILC}, with \textbf{polarized beams and 
high luminosity}, offers a unique opportunity for precise measurements well above the resonance, where both $Z^0$ and photon exchanges are present. 
%This additional complexity may turn up to be of a great advantage since it allows, through $\gamma - Z^0$ interference, to be sensitive to the sign of $Z^0$ couplings and fully solve the LEP~I puzzle in an unambiguous way. 
Recall that the LEP~I anomaly can be interpreted up to a sign ambiguity for what concerns the right‐handed coupling $Z^0 b\bar{b}$, referred 
hereafter as $g_R^Z$, which shows the largest deviation~\cite{bib:RSTOP}.

The $e^+ e^-\to b\bar{b}$ channel is studied at $\sqrt{s}=250$\,GeV using full simulation of the ILD experiment.
\color{DarkSlateGray}
The high-granularity of the ILD subdetectors allows for an individual particle reconstruction using the Particle Flow approach.
%The schematic view of the ILD concept and the subdetector layout is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:ILDScheme}.

%The Vertex Detector (VXD) has 3 double layers with about $3\,\mu$m  resolution on the track impact parameters.  
%The vertex reconstruction algorithms are able to separate the secondary and tertiary vertices from b-hadrons.

%This enables a highly efficient b- and c-tagging of the jets and a detailed b-hadron vertex reconstruction. 
%The central tracker of the ILD detector is Time Projection Chamber (TPC), which will provide up to 224 points per track allowing for $dE/dx$-based particle identification.


The main goal of the study is to reconstruct the b-quark polar angle distributions for both beam polarization cases at the ILC. 
From that, the precision on the b-quark electroweak couplings is determined and compared to the LEP~I results.

\color{Blue}
The b-quark polar angle reconstruction requires an accurate b-quark charge measurement. 
The b-quark charge is identified using two basic signatures:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Vertex charge} is a sum of all reconstructed particles charges, which are associated to the b-hadron vertices. 
	\item \textbf{Kaon charge} is a charge of kaons found in b-hadron vertices. 
\end{itemize}

\color{DarkSlateGray}
%Sometimes, the vertex reconstruction algorithms may fail and lose one or several particles from the reconstructed b-hadron vertices. This leads to a wrong vertex charge measurement. 
%The reasons behind the missing b-hadron particles are connected to reconstruction shortcomings or to a low momentum or a low offset of the b-hadron particles. 
The developed Vertex Charge Recovery procedure enhances the vertex charge purity by adding the missing particles back to the reconstructed vertices. 


The kaon identification is possible using the TPC $dE/dx$ information. After equalizing the $dE/dx$ in angular spectrum, the kaons from b-hadron vertices can be identified with 97.\% purity and 87\% efficiency.
% However, the $B-\bar{B}$ oscillations will degrade the kaon charge signature purity for $B^0$ mesons.

\section*{B-quark polar angle reconstruction}

The reconstructed b-quark polar angle distributions at $\sqrt{s} = 250$\,GeV using a combination of kaon and vertex charge signatures are demonstrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:BAsymmetryFinal_3}. The integrated luminosity $\mathcal{L}_I = 250$\,fb$^{-1}$ is assumed for each beam polarization.

\end{center}\vspace{1cm}
%../ILD/plots/zoom-final.pdf
%There are two major problems found in the initial reconstructed distributions:
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item \textbf{Event migration}, caused by b-quark charge impurity;
%	\item \textbf{Acceptance effect}, which is the reduced efficiency of the vertexing algorithms in the very forward region $|\cos\theta| > 0.8$;
%\end{itemize}
The kaon and vertex charge purity is defined using the measured events with misreconstructed charges. Using the measured purities, the reconstructed spectrum is corrected using a data-driven procedure.
The background contribution is small. 
The distributions are fitted by the general cross section function, defined as 
\begin{equation}
{\color{Blue}	S (1+\cos^2\theta) + A \cos\theta,}
\end{equation}
where the fitted $S$ and $A$ parameters are proportional to the total cross section and the difference between the number of bottom quarks in the forward and backward hemisphere, respectively. 
The b-quark elecroweak couplings are derived using the fitted parameters. 
\section*{Interpretation}

The relative precisions on the $Z^0b\bar{b}$ couplings, $g_L^Z$ and $g_R^Z$, for the LEP~I measurements and for the expected ILC performance are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:LEPILCResult_3}. The ILC precision on the $g_R^Z$ coupling is enough to fully confirm or discard the New Physics influence.

\section*{Conclusions}

\begin{itemize}
\item The developed procedure of the b-quark charge reconstruction allows to measuring the b-quark polar angle. The residual impurity is corrected by a data-driven procedure;
\item The b-quark polar angle fit allows for the independent determination of four electroweak couplings of the b-quark. The fit can be extended to incluce also a term proportional tp $\sin^2\theta$, giving access to an independent determination of the tensorial couplings;
\item  The relative precision on the right-handed coupling $dg^Z_R/g^Z_R\approx 2$\% at the ILC is sufficient to confirm at $>5\,\sigma$ or to discard the LEP~I effect, which is at the 25\% level;
\item A reach of $\Lambda \approx 10$\,TeV is achievable for indirect New Physics searches.
%\item The statistical precision after the first $\sqrt{s} = 250\,$GeV ILC program will be almost 5 times better than at LEP;
\end{itemize}

\section*{Forthcoming Research}
The b-quark charge technique was originally developed for the t-quark polar angle measurement in the semileptonic decay channel and it can be applied to the fully hadronic $t\bar{t}$ decays.
The kaon charge method can be extended on the c-quark polar angle analysis, where one can improve the LEP~I results on the c-quark couplings precision. 
Hence, at the ILC one can measure the top, bottom and charm quark electroweak couplings with an excellent sensitivity to New Physics effects.
