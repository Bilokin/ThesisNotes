%  This is the template for the front and back covers of the thesis 
%  as demanded by the Paris Saclay University. It is a somewhat
%  crude draft, so don't hesitate to adjust it by twitching the
%  \hspace{} and \vspace{} distances in order to meet your needs,
%  and also the font size of the abstract (mine was rather long
%  so I had to invent rather wide fields along with the rather compact text)
%  Also mind that it has to be compiled with LaTeX twice.
%  Enjoy!

    			  This thesis presents studies for the International Linear Collider (ILC), a linear electron-positron collider with a nominal center-of-mass energy from 250\,GeV to 500\,GeV.
    			  
    			  Data are analysed that were recorded with the physics prototype of the CALICE silicon-tungsten electromagnetic calorimeter (\ecal) prototype at FermiLab in 2008. During this thesis, a track-finding algorithm was developed, which finds secondary tracks in hadronic events recorded by the \ecalp. This algorithm reveals details of hadronic interactions in the detector volume and the results are compared with simulations based on the the \geant\ toolkit.
    			  
    			  Indirect searches of New Physics require a high precision on the measurements of the \sm\ parameters. Theories of physics beyond \sm\ imply modifications of electroweak couplings of the heavy quarks top and bottom. The second part of the thesis is a full simulation study of vertexing algorithms in the ILD environment and the reconstruction of the b-quark charge. The b-quark charge reconstruction is essential for many physics channels at the ILC, particularly, for the $e^+e^-\to b\bar{b}$ and the $e^+e^-\to t\bar{t}$ channels.
    			  The developed algorithm improves the b-quark charge reconstruction performance.
    			  
    			  The b-quark charge reconstruction methods are applied to the \ttbar\ production process. This allows to increase statistics for the top quark electroweak form factor estimation w.r.t an earlier study and thus to decrease corresponding statistical uncertainties.
    			  
    			  The results of the detector study allow for an estimation of the ILC precision on the b-quark electroweak couplings and form factors. The ILC will be able to resolve the LEP anomaly in the \bbbar\ production process. The ILC precision on the right-handed $Z^0b\bar{b}$ coupling, a prime candidate for effects of new physics, is calculated to be at least 5 times better than the LEP experiments. %%% replace by the text of the abstract in English %%%
