One can look for the charged kaons among the generated prongs of the b-hadrons and study the charge correlation between $K^\pm$ charge and initial b-hadron charge. Figure~\ref{fig:KaonOscillation_3} shows, that the neutral b-hadrons have higher chances to produce $K^\pm$ with an opposite charge to the parent b-hadron, which means that the $B^0-\bar{B}^0$ oscillations are enabled in {\sc pythia} event generator.
